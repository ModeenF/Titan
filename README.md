Titan

Non-linear video editor.
-------------------------------

Bringing Titan to where it belongs: Haiku.

The code will be continually stripped of portability considerations and Windows code will be fully removed.

---

Titan was once functional on BeOS and much of the code for BeOS remains, however further development continued with a Windows-exclusive focus.

This means that portability has been lost.  Class definitions have been altered - radically, in many cases.  We are also starting without a build engine, and have selected to use Jam to create a one.
