*
* This class is your average mixer. It takes a list of
* buffers (EMMediaDataBuffer) and adds them together and
* returns the result. 
*
* To be more specific, it takes the first buffer in the
* list and uses that as the destination for the additions.
* It loops through the remaining lists, adds each sample
* to the corresponding sample in the destination, and
* then Recycles the source.
*
* It also knows the next destination (since it inherits
* from EMBeBufferDestination, it is a destination as well
* as knows the next destination) so it updates the
* destination of the returned buffer.
*
* This class is typically instantiated once for each
* EMMediaTrack, and used for mixing overlapping (within
* the track) audio clips.
